How to apply patches made by the randomizer
using CEMU
###########################################

1. Find your CEMU folder (it should be called something like cemu-{version}, where {version}
   is the CEMU version (e.g, 1.15.3).

2. Drag and drop the 'mlc01' folder you find in the RandomizerOutput folder (the one where this file is) into your
   CEMU folder.

3. You should get a prompt about conflicting files.
   Select 'Merge All'.

4. Launch Breath of the Wild using CEMU.

5. Verify the patches are loaded by looking at the game version. It should be
   '1.5.0-Randomized'.
   If you are using any of the built-in profiles, you can also verify it by teleporting to the
   'Hia Miu Shrine' (the one in the top-left corner of the map). It should be mossy instead of snowy.


Note: It is recommended to use a different save file for the randomized version.

   You should see these folders: 'RandomizerOutput', 'RandomizerProfiles',
   'RandomizerLocations' and 'RandomizerBackup'.

2. Open the 'RandomizerBackup' folder.

3. Follow steps 1-4 from the guide above.

4. Verify the patches are reverted by confirming that the game version is '1.5.0'.
