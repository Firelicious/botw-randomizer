How to apply patches made by the randomizer
on a real Wii U using SDCafiine
###########################################

1. Install SDCafiine if you haven't already.
   More info can be found here: https://github.com/Maschell/SDCafiine

2. Insert your SD card into your computer, and open it using
   your file explorer.

3. Drag and drop the 'sdcafiine' folder you find in the RandomizerOutput folder (the one where this file is) into your
   SD card.

4. Safely eject the SD card from your computer, and insert it into your Wii U console.

5. Get into the Homebrew Launcher and launch SDCafiine.
   You'll see the system menu after it's loaded.

6. Launch Breath of the Wild.

7. Verify the patches are loaded by looking at the game version. It should be
   '1.5.0-Randomized'.
   If you are using any of the built-in profiles, you can also verify it by teleporting to the
   Hia Miu Shrine' (the one in the top-left corner of the map). It should be mossy instead of snowy.

Note: It is recommended to use a different save file for the randomized version.
